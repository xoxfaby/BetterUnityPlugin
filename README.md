# BetterUnityPlugin

A BaseUnityPlugin that provides a HookManager and some events for MonoBehaviour messages

BetterUnityPlugin has been removed from Thunderstore

Due to continued harrassment from a part of the RoR2 Modding community and Thunderstore's lack of action regarding these spite-fueled individuals, I've decided to remove myself and my mods from this toxicity. 

If you want to follow my other stuff or contact me about this, feel free to join my discord at https://discord.faby.dev but please be aware that this decision is final.
